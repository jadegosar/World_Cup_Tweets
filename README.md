### Defining the Project Question
The Men's World Cup in 2022 was one filled with team successes, failures, upsets, injuries, controversy, and at the very end one singular world champion. To be fair, each World Cup is filled with moments just like the one the most previous one, taking fans along for an emotional ride that is four years in the making. I wanted to explore the sentiment surrounding the World Cup, an event that stretches across international borders and captivates the world for a few months every time it rolls around. To investigate the big ideas and concepts surrounding the 2022 World Cup, I decided to get a dataset from Kaggle that contains tweets about the World Cup as well as a few other important variables such as date created, number of likes on the tweet, and the source of the tweet. Additionally, the dataset has categorized each tweet as having a "positive", "negative", or "neutral" sentiment. Due to this dataset already contained sentiments of the tweet, I will focus more on contextualizing important topics throughout the World Cup and tracking sentiment over time. This will be completed through cleaning data specific to twitter and visualization wordclouds to show bigrams that are of importance in the dataset. Then sentiment over time will be explored in the initial data analysis and LDA will be performed to show the topics that were most important in a sample of the dataset.
